# ðŸš€ DQN LunarLander Agent
This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to solve the LunarLander-v2 environment from OpenAI Gym. The goal is to train an agent to successfully land a lunar module using reinforcement learning techniques.

# ðŸ§  Algorithms Used
- Deep Q-Learning (DQN)

- Experience Replay Buffer

- Îµ-greedy Action Selection

- Target Network for stability

- Neural Network (Keras/TensorFlow) for Q-value approximation

# ðŸ“ˆ Training Performance

- Trained for 500 episodes

- Reward increased as exploration decayed

- Final performance: agent learns to land smoothly with growing consistency
